    "# Task Management in FreeRTOS\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: This tutorial covers the Free Rtos to  create a new Task and aim to understand  its significance in Rtos.\n",

    "### About Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each task is a small program (preferably C function) in its own right. \n",
    "- An application can consist of many tasks. \n",
    "- If Application is running on single core processor,then only one task can be executing at any given time. This means when one task is running on the core, others are not running. Based on scheduling policy,a single core is time shared bewteen tasks. When a task from 'not-running' state transits to 'running' state, it is said to be 'Swapped-In' or 'Switched-In'. When a task from 'running' state transits to 'not-running' state it is said to be 'Swapped-Out' or 'Switched-Out'. \n",
    "- The FreeRTOS scheduler is the only entity that can switch a task in and out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has an entry point, will normally run forever within an infinite loop, and will not exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- FreeRTOS tasks must not be allowed to return from their implementing function in any way— they must not contain a ‘return’ statement and must not be allowed to execute past the end of the function. If a task is no longer required, it should instead be explicitly deleted.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- A single task function definition can be used to create any number of tasks—each created task being a separate execution instance, with its own stack and its own copy of any automatic (stack) variables defined within the task itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A task have two states: \"Running\" and \"Not running\". All task that are not currently running are in Not Running state whereas only one task can be in the Running state at any one time.\n"

    "\n",
    "> **pxCreatedTask**: pxCreatedTask can be used to pass out a handle to the task being created. This handle can then be used to reference the task in API calls that, for example, change the task priority or delete the task."
